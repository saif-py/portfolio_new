# Richard Sanchez — Portfolio

This repository contains a responsive single-page portfolio site for Richard Sanchez. The site is intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages from the `main` branch (root).

Local development

1. Open `index.html` in a browser or use a local static server:

    ```powershell
    cd 'c:\misc\projects\portfolio_new\portfolio_new'
    # start a simple server (Python must be installed)
    python -m http.server 8000
    # then open http://localhost:8000
    ```

Edit the content

- Update project links, dates, and detailed experience in `index.html` to match your resume exactly.
- Replace the placeholder email in `index.html` (currently `richard.sanchez@example.com`) with your real contact email.

Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the repository is pushed to GitHub and `main` is selected as the Pages source (Settings -> Pages -> Branch: main -> / (root)).
2. Wait a few minutes and visit: `https://saif-py.github.io/portfolio_new/`
